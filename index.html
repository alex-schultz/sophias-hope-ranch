                There are over 60,000 failed adoptions each year. Many hopeful and well-meaning families set out to grow
                their families through adoption. Unfortunately, they are not prepared for the big feelings and behaviors
                that come from attachment disruption and return the child back into the system.
            </p>
            <p class="small-bottom-spacing">
                Regardless of the way the adoption occurred, every adoption begins with loss and grief. Due to this loss
                and grief, the child may have difficulty forming emotional attachments with their new caregivers, have
                extreme aggression, power struggles, defiance, or withdrawal. Attachment disruption affects the adopted
                child’s emotional, behavioral, cognitive, social, and overall well-being, as well as the well-being of
                the entire family. That is why the family is the client, not only the child.

            <h3>My Story</h3>
            <p class="small-bottom-spacing">
                Welcome to the heart of Sophia’s Hope Ranch, a place born from a profound personal journey and a
                deep-seated commitment to transforming the lives of children and families. My name is Theresa Schultz,
                and my path as a devoted Christ-follower, mother, and clinical therapist has led me to this pivotal
                moment. With five grown children - two adopted, three biological - and three wonderful grandchildren, my
                life has been a tapestry woven with love, advocacy, and unyielding dedication to nurturing children in
                need.
            </p>

            <p class="small-bottom-spacing">
                For over two decades, I have channeled my passion for advocating for children into various roles, from
                serving on numerous boards to fostering over a dozen children and dedicating 12 years as a CASA. My
                professional journey as a clinical therapist specializing in trauma and attachment has been both
                challenging and rewarding, shaping my understanding of the profound needs of children and families
                navigating their own struggles.
            </p>

            <p class="small-bottom-spacing">The inception of Sophia’s Hope Ranch is deeply personal. When I first
                adopted
                my daughter at nine months
                old, her struggles with Reactive Attachment Disorder were heartbreaking and isolating. I felt the weight
                of her pain and the absence of sufficient resources to support her effectively. Determined to change
                this reality, I delved into research and sought out every possible avenue for support. The journey was
                arduous, but it ignited a fire within me to ensure that no other family would face such trials
                alone.</p>

            <p class="small-bottom-spacing">
                With the passage of time and the accumulation of resources, I am finally able to bring this dream to
                fruition. Sophia’s Hope Ranch stands as a testament to the belief that even amidst our deepest
                struggles, God’s grace and redemption can turn pain into purpose. We are committed to offering healing,
                support, and comfort to those who need it most, guided by the conviction that what was once meant for
                harm can be transformed into something profoundly good.
            </p>

            <p class="medium-bottom-spacing">
                Join us as we embark on this mission to create a sanctuary of hope and healing, where every child and
                family can find solace, strength, and the unwavering support they deserve.</p>
